# Integration Status Report - 2025-08-06

## What's Working ✅

### 1. Authentication Flow
- KAM successfully authenticates requests with Bearer token
- Orchestrator v2 now accepts both `bitware_key_account_manager` and `bitware-key-account-manager` worker IDs
- Fixed authentication token mismatch (WORKER_SECRET vs WORKER_SHARED_SECRET)

### 2. Execution Creation
- KAM successfully calls Orchestrator v2's `/execute` endpoint
- Execution records are created in the database
- Execution is properly queued
- Queue processing picks up the execution

### 3. Resource Management (Bypassed)
- Resource estimation works (returns default values)
- Resource reservation bypassed to avoid hanging
- Pipeline proceeds without resource allocation

### 4. Master Template Fetching
- Orchestrator successfully fetches master templates from KAM
- Template structure parsed correctly

## What's Not Working ❌

### 1. Stage Creation
- Pipeline executor reaches stage creation but stages are not being created
- The execution shows as "running" but with 0 stages completed

### 2. Worker Handshake
- Content Granulator is not receiving handshake requests
- No new jobs appearing in granulator database
- Worker coordinator's `invokeWorker` method may have issues with:
  - Action mapping (expecting 'execute_template' but getting different value)
  - Template ID extraction from parameters

### 3. Progress Tracking
- Execution stays at 0% progress
- No stage executions visible in database

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue appears to be in the pipeline execution flow:

1. **Stage Structure**: The master template's `pipeline_stages` field contains stage information, but the exact structure and how `action` is determined is unclear.

2. **Worker Invocation**: The `WorkerCoordinator.invokeWorker()` method has special handling for `action === 'execute_template'` which looks for `template_id` in the data, but:
   - We're passing different parameters (topic, targetAudience)
   - The action value from the stage might not be 'execute_template'

3. **Handshake Protocol**: The handshake expects specific data structure but might be receiving incompatible format.

## Quick Fixes Implemented

1. **Resource Bypass**: Commented out resource reservation to avoid hanging
2. **KV TTL Fix**: Changed from 30 to 60 seconds minimum
3. **Auth Fix**: Added support for both worker ID formats
4. **Token Fix**: Added fallback for WORKER_SECRET environment variable

## Next Steps

1. **Debug Stage Creation**:
   - Add logging to see exact stage structure
   - Verify stage.action value
   - Check if stages are being created in DB

2. **Fix Worker Handshake**:
   - Update invokeWorker to handle granulator properly
   - Map action correctly for content granulator
   - Ensure template_ref is passed correctly

3. **Test Direct Handshake**:
   - Call granulator handshake endpoint directly
   - Verify expected request format
   - Update orchestrator to match

## Test Commands

```bash
# Execute request through KAM
curl -X POST https://bitware-key-account-manager.jhaladik.workers.dev/requests/req_1754419678174_wumusc9is/execute \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer internal-worker-auth-token-2024" \
  -H "X-Worker-ID: test-client" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"parameters": {"topic": "Test Topic", "targetAudience": "beginners"}}'

# Check execution progress
curl -X GET https://bitware-orchestrator-v2.jhaladik.workers.dev/progress/[EXECUTION_ID] \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer internal-worker-auth-token-2024" \
  -H "X-Worker-ID: bitware-key-account-manager"

# Check granulator jobs
curl -X GET https://bitware-content-granulator.jhaladik.workers.dev/api/jobs \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer internal-worker-auth-token-2024" \
  -H "X-Worker-ID: test-client"
```

## Current Execution State

Last test execution: `exec_1754467280657_o3tu0cqdj`
- Status: Running
- Progress: 0%
- Stages: 0/1 completed
- Started: 2025-08-06T08:01:20.877Z

The execution is stuck at the stage creation phase, preventing the handshake with Content Granulator.
