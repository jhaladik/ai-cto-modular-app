# Orchestrator v2 Debug Summary for Next Chat

## Current State (2025-08-06)

### What's Working ✅
1. **Queue Management**: Executions are properly queued and picked up for processing
2. **Master Template Fetching**: Successfully retrieves templates from KAM
3. **Database Operations**: Basic CRUD operations work
4. **Resource Estimation**: Simplified version returns default estimates
5. **KV Limits**: Resolved by moving to paid plan

### What's Failing ❌
1. **Resource Reservation**: Pipeline hangs at `ResourceManager.reserve()`
2. **Stage Creation**: Never reached due to resource reservation failure
3. **Worker Handshake**: Never reached
4. **Pipeline Completion**: Never reached

## Execution Trace
```
1. KAM calls POST /execute → ✅
2. Execution created in DB → ✅
3. Added to queue → ✅
4. Queue processor picks up → ✅
5. Fetches master template → ✅
6. Calls PipelineExecutor → ✅
7. Updates status to 'running' → ✅
8. Estimates resources → ✅
9. Reserves resources → ❌ HANGS HERE
```

## Root Cause Analysis

### Resource Manager Issues
The `ResourceManager.reserve()` method is likely hanging because:
1. Complex database queries for availability checking
2. Trying to query historical usage data that doesn't exist
3. No timeout handling on database operations
4. Circular dependencies in resource checking logic

### Database Schema Problems
1. **Naming Inconsistencies**:
   - Mix of snake_case and camelCase
   - Singular vs plural table names
   - Mismatched column names between tables

2. **Missing Data**:
   - No historical resource usage data
   - Empty resource allocation tables
   - No worker performance metrics

## Quick Fix for Next Session

### 1. Bypass Resource Management
```typescript
// In pipeline-executor.ts
// Comment out resource reservation entirely
// const resourceAllocation = await this.resourceManager.reserve(...)
// Just set a dummy allocation
const resourceAllocation = { success: true, allocations: ['dummy'] };
```

### 2. Simplify Resource Checking
```typescript
// In resource-manager.ts
async reserve() {
  // Just return success for now
  return { success: true, allocations: ['alloc_1'], failures: [] };
}
```

### 3. Add Timeouts
```typescript
// Wrap all DB operations with timeout
const timeoutPromise = new Promise((_, reject) => 
  setTimeout(() => reject(new Error('Timeout')), 5000)
);
await Promise.race([dbOperation, timeoutPromise]);
```

## Full Solution Plan

### Phase 1: Get Pipeline Working
1. Bypass resource management
2. Focus on stage creation and handshake
3. Test end-to-end flow with Content Granulator

### Phase 2: Fix Resource Management
1. Remove historical queries
2. Use simple in-memory counters
3. Add proper error handling
4. Implement timeouts

### Phase 3: Complete Integration
1. Re-enable resource management
2. Add monitoring and metrics
3. Implement retry logic
4. Add comprehensive logging

## Test Command
```bash
curl -X POST https://bitware-key-account-manager.jhaladik.workers.dev/requests/req_1754419678174_wumusc9is/execute \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer internal-worker-auth-token-2024" \
  -H "X-Worker-ID: test-client" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"parameters": {"topic": "Test Topic", "targetAudience": "beginners"}}'
```

## Expected Logs When Working
```
1. Creating execution...
2. Execution created successfully
3. Processing queue...
4. Fetching master template...
5. Template received...
6. Executing pipeline...
7. Estimating resources...
8. Reserving resources...
9. Creating stage execution...
10. Invoking worker handshake...
11. Worker accepted handshake...
12. Triggering worker process...
13. Monitoring progress...
14. Stage completed...
15. Pipeline completed successfully
```

## Key Files to Check
1. `/workers/bitware_orchestrator_v2/src/services/resource-manager.ts` - Hanging here
2. `/workers/bitware_orchestrator_v2/src/services/pipeline-executor.ts` - Main execution flow
3. `/workers/bitware_orchestrator_v2/src/services/worker-coordinator.ts` - Handshake implementation
4. `/workers/bitware_content_granulator/src/handlers/handshake-ops.ts` - Worker side handshake

## Database Tables to Monitor
- `pipeline_executions` - Check status
- `execution_queue` - Check processing state
- `stage_executions` - Should have entries (currently empty)
- `resource_allocations` - Should have entries (currently empty)

## Success Criteria
1. Execution completes with status 'completed'
2. Stage executions are created
3. Worker handshake succeeds
4. Content Granulator receives and processes job
5. Results are stored and accessible
